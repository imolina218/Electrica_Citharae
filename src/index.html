                    <p>-Fabricators: Fender and Squier</p>
                    <p>-First production in 1954</p>
                    <p>-The Fender Stratocaster history<br>
                        starts in 1954 when three men,<br>
                        Leo Fender, Freddie Tavares and<br>
                        George Fullerton designed the<br>
                        first double cutaway guitar which<br>
                        has gone on to change the history<br> 
                        of guitars. The first Fender to<br> 
                        be produced came in a solitary <br>
                        piece ash body with a two-color<br> 
                        sunburst finish.</p>
                    <p>-Artists that use it: <br>Jimmy Hendrix <br>Eric Clapton 
                                            <br>David Gilmour <br>George Harrison
                                            <br>Eddie Van Halen

                        To compete with more high-end instruments from other manufacturers—particularly
                        Gibsons Les Paul, introduced in 1952 in response to what Randall once called 
                        the “plain Jane” Telecaster—the Stratocaster was a marked step up in design 
                        and innovation for Fender. It had not one or two but three pickups, with switching 
                        and controls that created great tonal versatility (although, curiously, the 
                        switching configuration allowed only three of several possible pickup combinations).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Other Stratocaster innovations included single-coil alnico 3 pickups with 
                        staggered-height pole pieces that effectively addressed the varying output 
                        of the heavy string gauges in use at the time, and a slanting output jack 
                        mounted on the face of the guitar rather than the side.<br> 
                        The guitars distinctively shaped headstock—more fully curvaceous than that of the 
                        Telecaster and Precision Bass—was undoubtedly influenced by instruments 
                        built by Paul Bigsby and, like the Telecaster and Precision Bass before it, 
                        had all the tuners within easy reach on one side.

                        The Stratocasters electronics were mounted to the single-ply white plastic 
                        pickguard (anodized aluminum on some early models) rather than to the body, 
                        enabling an entire pickguard/pickups/controls assembly to be dropped in place 
                        and screwed on (using eight screws) and only requiring connection to the output jack.

                        As design refinements preceded throughout late 1953 and early 1954, Leo and 
                        his staff were ably abetted by several western swing guitarists in addition 
                        to Gallion and Carson who were happy to field-test Stratocaster prototypes 
                        in local nightclubs. Their input was invaluable, and while the Stratocaster 
                        was in one sense Leo baby through and through, it was in another sense the 
                        collaborative work of a remarkable group of designers and musicians.

                        Holly was one of the first artists to bring the Fender Stratocaster into<br> 
                        the mainstream, as his sunburst Strat became as iconic as his black-rimmed glasses.<br>
                        But the stratocasters continue evolving thanks to artists like Jimmy Hendrix, Eric Clapton,<br>
                        Eddie Van Halen, George Harrison, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck and so on up to this day.

                        The Stratocaster is, well, an icon. It was there at the very beginning of<br> 
                        rock and roll and has been an identifiable, irreplaceable part of popular<br> 
                        music ever since—spanning blues, funk, punk, country, psych, and<br> 
                        any other genre you might care to name.

                        from today. Fenders newly named “Telecaster”<br> 
                        was creating a small storm in the guitar-playing<br> 
                        world, proving that Les Paul’s solid-bodied vision<br> 
                        wasn’t as out there as Gibson first thought.<br> 
                        Unsurprisingly, that same year, Ted McCarty and his<br> 
                        team began work on what would eventually become<br>

                    <p>
                        The story of the Les Paul’s genesis is surprisingly protracted. 
                        While Les Paul himself saw the potential of a solid bodied electric 
                        guitar as far back as 1945, it took seven years for Gibson president 
                        Ted McCarty to share his vision. And even then, the first Les Pauls 
                        that arrived on the market were very different beasts from the one 
                        we now know.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we think of the solid-body electric guitar boom, we inevitably 
                        think of the early-to-mid 1950s. But the story of the Les Paul goes 
                        back further. In 1945, Les Paul – already a respected guitar 
                        innovator – presented Gibson with his idea for a solid-body Spanish 
                        guitar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gibson wanted a well-made, expensive instrument that fit their 
                        reputation as a high-end instrument manufacturer – a clone of the 
                        Tele this was not. In late 1951, they approached Les Paul with a 
                        prototype of their new instrument, and an enquiry; they wanted to 
                        imprint Les’ name on the headstock to increase sales.

                    <p>
                        It would be 1957 before the final component of the classic Gibson 
                        Les Paul was put in place. The P90s of earlier models were replaced 
                        with new “humbucker” pickups designed by Gibson.

                        In 1958, Gibson phased out the Gold Top finish, replacing it with<br> 
                        their enduring Sunburst design. Yet, these sunburst Les Pauls,<br> 
                        produced between 1958 and 1960, were not a hit with consumers. A<br> 
                        mere 1700 units were sold in those two years, prompting Gibson to<br> 
                        drop them altogether in 1961.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1964, Keith Richards purchased a 1959 Sunburst instrument, becoming<br> 
                        the first guitarist on the British scene to use one. His peers followed<br>
                        suit. Eric Clapton switched to a Les Paul in 1965, inspired by Freddie<br> 
                        King. By the end of the 1960s, Peter Green, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page<br> 
                        were bearing the charge of the Les Paul resurgence.

                    <p>
                        The Les Paul had a tough time trying to be what it is today, but that<br>
                        doesn't make it any less of a stratocaster. It was and still is wielded by<br>
                        some of the best rock and roll bands and artists, without ever losing the touch that<br>
                        was meant to have.
